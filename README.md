# Stroke_ML
Project_4_Group_1 : https://github.com/maproctor95/Stroke_ML
## Overview of Project
* Data Model Implementation
    * Student produces an analytical model in Python that fulfills all the following specifications:
        * Script initializes, trains, and evaluates a model, or loads a pretrained model from hyperparameter tuning
        * Script cleans, normalizes, and standardizes input data prior to modeling
        * Model utilizes data retrieved from a relational database or big data source (SQL or Spark)
        * Model demonstrates meaningful predictive power (>75% classification accuracy, >80 R-squared)
        
* Data Model Optimization
    * Clear, well-documented evidence of model optimization and performance evaluation in the form of one of the following:
    * A CSV/Excel table showing model designs, testing parameters, and model performance
    * A Python script that utilizes hyperparameter tuning logic
    * Overall model performance is printed or displayed at the end of the script

* Project and Documentation Uploaded to Github
    * Successfully uploaded to GitHub; demonstrating professional quality of presentation
    * GitHub repository is free of unnecessary files and folders and has an appropriate .gitignore in use
    * The README is customized to a professional level
    
* Group Presentation

    * Slides are visually clean and professional
    * Slides are relevant to material
    * Slides effectively demonstrate project
    * Slides are clear and maintain audience interest
    
### Purpose
   
* Predict likelihood of having a stroke based on their life circumstances (e.g., urban vs. rural location, history of smoking, type of job, pre-existing health conditions)

## Analysis

* Data Model Implementation
    * We used Kaggle data from : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset
